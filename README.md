# Task Killer

A desktop application to force close non-responsive programs.


## Download:

Download the dist folder and extract to a folder.

Now run the "TaskKiller.exe" file as admin and you are good to go.
The program will automatically close non-responsive programs every 10 seconds.
To stop the program, just close the window.


## How to run as admin:
**Windows 10**
<div align="center">
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwxVFUXhUqE"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/CwxVFUXhUqE/0.jpg" alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT"></a>
</div>

Another way is to right-click the .exe file.  Click on properties, near the bottom of the list.
Under properties go to the Compatibility tab.  At the bottom of the compatibility tab you will see "Run this program as an administrator", ensure that the box is ticked.

TaskKiller.exe > Right-Click > Properties > Compatibility > Run this program as an administrator


## Use:

If you want to close all non-responsive programs leave the Process Name box blank, however if you want to force close a specific application, then type that application name in.

For example, if I wanted to close Google Chrome when it becomes unresponsive I would put "chrome.exe".  These values can be found in the task manager.  Find the process you are looking to force close under the process tab.  Right-click said process and click "Go to details".  It will take you to the details tab, and will highlight the process, that is the name you will want to put in the Process Name box.


## TODO:

* Add a cashe system, to close programs after they have been unresponsive after some time.
